# Keystone Blog

Blog API created with KeystoneJS

You probably want to add Lists, Authentication, Access control and a front-end application.

## Running the Project.

To run this project first run `npm install`

Once running the Keystone Admin UI is reachable via: `localhost:3000/admin`.

## Next steps

This example has no front-end application but you can build your own using the GraphQL API (`http://localhost:3000/admin/graphiql`).
